<purpose>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need. Analyze the phase to identify gray areas, let the user choose what to discuss, then deep-dive each selected area until satisfied.

You are a thinking partner, not an interviewer. The user is the visionary — you are the builder. Your job is to capture decisions that will guide research and planning, not to figure out implementation yourself.
</purpose>

<downstream_awareness>
**CONTEXT.md feeds into:**

1. **gsd-phase-researcher** — Reads CONTEXT.md to know WHAT to research
   - "User wants card-based layout" → researcher investigates card component patterns
   - "Infinite scroll decided" → researcher looks into virtualization libraries

2. **gsd-planner** — Reads CONTEXT.md to know WHAT decisions are locked
   - "Pull-to-refresh on mobile" → planner includes that in task specs
   - "Claude's Discretion: loading skeleton" → planner can decide approach

**Your job:** Capture decisions clearly enough that downstream agents can act on them without asking the user again.

**Not your job:** Figure out HOW to implement. That's what research and planning do with the decisions you capture.
</downstream_awareness>

<philosophy>
**User = founder/visionary. Claude = builder.**

The user knows:
- How they imagine it working
- What it should look/feel like
- What's essential vs nice-to-have
- Specific behaviors or references they have in mind

The user doesn't know (and shouldn't be asked):
- Codebase patterns (researcher reads the code)
- Technical risks (researcher identifies these)
- Implementation approach (planner figures this out)
- Success metrics (inferred from the work)

Ask about vision and implementation choices. Capture decisions for downstream agents.
</philosophy>

<scope_guardrail>
**CRITICAL: No scope creep.**

The phase boundary comes from ROADMAP.md and is FIXED. Discussion clarifies HOW to implement what's scoped, never WHETHER to add new capabilities.

**Allowed (clarifying ambiguity):**
- "How should posts be displayed?" (layout, density, info shown)
- "What happens on empty state?" (within the feature)
- "Pull to refresh or manual?" (behavior choice)

**Not allowed (scope creep):**
- "Should we also add comments?" (new capability)
- "What about search/filtering?" (new capability)
- "Maybe include bookmarking?" (new capability)

**The heuristic:** Does this clarify how we implement what's already in the phase, or does it add a new capability that could be its own phase?

**When user suggests scope creep:**
```
"[Feature X] would be a new capability — that's its own phase.
Want me to note it for the roadmap backlog?

For now, let's focus on [phase domain]."
```

Capture the idea in a "Deferred Ideas" section. Don't lose it, don't act on it.
</scope_guardrail>

<gray_area_identification>
Gray areas are **implementation decisions the user cares about** — things that could go multiple ways and would change the result.

**How to identify gray areas:**

1. **Read the phase goal** from ROADMAP.md
2. **Understand the domain** — What kind of thing is being built?
   - Something users SEE → visual presentation, interactions, states matter
   - Something users CALL → interface contracts, responses, errors matter
   - Something users RUN → invocation, output, behavior modes matter
   - Something users READ → structure, tone, depth, flow matter
   - Something being ORGANIZED → criteria, grouping, handling exceptions matter
3. **Generate phase-specific gray areas** — Not generic categories, but concrete decisions for THIS phase

**Don't use generic category labels** (UI, UX, Behavior). Generate specific gray areas:

```
Phase: "User authentication"
→ Session handling, Error responses, Multi-device policy, Recovery flow

Phase: "Organize photo library"
→ Grouping criteria, Duplicate handling, Naming convention, Folder structure

Phase: "CLI for database backups"
→ Output format, Flag design, Progress reporting, Error recovery

Phase: "API documentation"
→ Structure/navigation, Code examples depth, Versioning approach, Interactive elements
```

**The key question:** What decisions would change the outcome that the user should weigh in on?

**Claude handles these (don't ask):**
- Technical implementation details
- Architecture patterns
- Performance optimization
- Scope (roadmap defines this)
</gray_area_identification>

<process>

<step name="validate_phase" priority="first">
Phase number from argument (required).

Load and validate:
- Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- Find phase entry
- Extract: number, name, description, status

**If phase not found:**
```
Phase [X] not found in roadmap.

Use /gsd:progress to see available phases.
```
Exit workflow.

**If phase found:** Continue to analyze_phase.
</step>

<step name="check_existing">
Check if CONTEXT.md already exists:

```bash
# Match both zero-padded (05-*) and unpadded (5-*) folders
PADDED_PHASE=$(printf "%02d" ${PHASE})
ls .planning/phases/${PADDED_PHASE}-*/*-CONTEXT.md .planning/phases/${PHASE}-*/*-CONTEXT.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If exists:**
Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Context"
- question: "Phase [X] already has context. What do you want to do?"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - label: "Update it"
    description: "Review and revise existing context"
  - label: "View it"
    description: "Show me what's there"
  - label: "Skip"
    description: "Use existing context as-is"

If "Update": Load existing, continue to analyze_phase
If "View": Display CONTEXT.md, then offer update/skip
If "Skip": Exit workflow

**If doesn't exist:**

Check `has_plans` and `plan_count` from init. **If `has_plans` is true:**

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Plans exist"
- question: "Phase [X] already has {plan_count} plan(s) created without user context. Your decisions here won't affect existing plans unless you replan."
- options:
  - "Continue and replan after" — Capture context, then run /gsd:plan-phase {X} to replan
  - "View existing plans" — Show plans before deciding
  - "Cancel" — Skip discuss-phase

If "Continue and replan after": Continue to analyze_phase.
If "View existing plans": Display plan files, then offer "Continue" / "Cancel".
If "Cancel": Exit workflow.

**If `has_plans` is false:** Continue to analyze_phase.
</step>

<step name="analyze_phase">
Analyze the phase to identify gray areas worth discussing.

**Read the phase description from ROADMAP.md and determine:**

1. **Domain boundary** — What capability is this phase delivering? State it clearly.

2. **Gray areas by category** — For each relevant category (UI, UX, Behavior, Empty States, Content), identify 1-2 specific ambiguities that would change implementation.

3. **Skip assessment** — If no meaningful gray areas exist (pure infrastructure, clear-cut implementation), the phase may not need discussion.

**Output your analysis internally, then present to user.**

Example analysis for "Post Feed" phase:
```
Domain: Displaying posts from followed users
Gray areas:
- UI: Layout style (cards vs timeline vs grid)
- UI: Information density (full posts vs previews)
- Behavior: Loading pattern (infinite scroll vs pagination)
- Empty State: What shows when no posts exist
- Content: What metadata displays (time, author, reactions count)
```
</step>

<step name="present_gray_areas">
Present the domain boundary and gray areas to user.

**First, state the boundary:**
```
Phase [X]: [Name]
Domain: [What this phase delivers — from your analysis]

We'll clarify HOW to implement this.
(New capabilities belong in other phases.)
```

**Then use AskUserQuestion:**
- header: "Scope"
- question: "Which areas need discussion before planning?"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - label: "All gray areas"
    description: "Discuss every area where approach is unclear"
  - label: "High-risk only"
    description: "Focus on decisions that could cause rework if wrong"
  - label: "Quick defaults"
    description: "Accept recommendations, only discuss blockers"

**After selection, present specific gray areas using AskUserQuestion (multiSelect: true):**
- header: "Discuss"
- question: "Which specific areas do you want to discuss for [phase name]?"
- options: Generate 3-4 phase-specific gray areas, each formatted as:
  - label: "[Specific area]" — concrete, not generic (1-5 words)
  - description: [1-2 questions this covers]

**Do NOT include a "skip" or "you decide" option.** User ran this command to discuss — give them real choices.

**Examples by domain:**

For "Post Feed" (visual feature):
```
- label: "Layout style"
  description: "Cards vs list vs timeline? Information density?"
- label: "Loading behavior"
  description: "Infinite scroll or pagination? Pull to refresh?"
- label: "Content ordering"
  description: "Chronological, algorithmic, or user choice?"
- label: "Post metadata"
  description: "What info per post? Timestamps, reactions, author?"
```

For "Database backup CLI" (command-line tool):
```
- label: "Output format"
  description: "JSON, table, or plain text? Verbosity levels?"
- label: "Flag design"
  description: "Short flags, long flags, or both? Required vs optional?"
- label: "Progress reporting"
  description: "Silent, progress bar, or verbose logging?"
- label: "Error recovery"
  description: "Fail fast, retry, or prompt for action?"
```

For "Organize photo library" (organization task):
```
- label: "Grouping criteria"
  description: "By date, location, faces, or events?"
- label: "Duplicate handling"
  description: "Keep best, keep all, or prompt each time?"
- label: "Naming convention"
  description: "Original names, dates, or descriptive?"
- label: "Folder structure"
  description: "Flat, nested by year, or by category?"
```

Continue to discuss_areas with selected areas.
</step>

<step name="discuss_areas">
For each selected area, conduct a focused discussion loop using AskUserQuestion.

**Philosophy: 4 questions, then check.**

Ask 4 questions per area before offering to continue or move on. Each answer often reveals the next question.

**For each area:**

1. **Announce the area:**
   ```
   Let's talk about [Area].
   ```

2. **Ask up to 4 questions using AskUserQuestion (batch related questions):**
   - header: "[Abbreviated area name]" (max 12 chars)
   - question: Specific decision for this area
   - multiSelect: false
   - options: 2-4 concrete choices with descriptions
     - label: "[Choice]" (1-5 words)
     - description: "[What this means]"
   - Include "You decide" as an option when reasonable — captures Claude discretion
   - AskUserQuestion automatically adds "Other" option

3. **After 4 questions, check using AskUserQuestion:**
   - header: "[Area]" (abbreviated, max 12 chars)
   - question: "More questions about [area], or move to next?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "More questions"
       description: "Continue exploring this area"
     - label: "Next area"
       description: "Move to next discussion topic"

   If "More questions" → ask 4 more, then check again
   If "Next area" → proceed to next selected area
   If "Other" (free text) → interpret intent: continuation phrases ("chat more", "keep going", "yes", "more") map to "More questions"; advancement phrases ("done", "move on", "next", "skip") map to "Next area". If ambiguous, ask: "Continue with more questions about [area], or move to the next area?"

4. **After all areas complete, use AskUserQuestion:**
   - header: "Finalize"
   - question: "Ready to finalize these decisions for planning?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "Finalize (Recommended)"
       description: "Lock decisions, proceed to research and planning"
     - label: "Revise decisions"
       description: "Go back and change specific decisions"
     - label: "Add more areas"
       description: "Discuss additional gray areas not yet covered"

**Question design:**
- Options should be concrete, not abstract ("Cards" not "Option A")
- Each answer should inform the next question
- If user picks "Other", receive their input, reflect it back, confirm

**Scope creep handling:**
If user mentions something outside the phase domain:
```
"[Feature] sounds like a new capability — that belongs in its own phase.
I'll note it as a deferred idea.

Back to [current area]: [return to current question]"
```

Track deferred ideas internally.

**Tool limitation note:**
AskUserQuestion is only available in foreground (orchestrator) context.
All structured questions must be asked by the orchestrator before/after spawning subagents.
</step>

<step name="write_context">
Create CONTEXT.md capturing decisions made.

**Find or create phase directory:**

```bash
# Match existing directory (padded or unpadded)
PADDED_PHASE=$(printf "%02d" ${PHASE})
PHASE_DIR=$(ls -d .planning/phases/${PADDED_PHASE}-* .planning/phases/${PHASE}-* 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -z "$PHASE_DIR" ]; then
  # Create from roadmap name (lowercase, hyphens)
  PHASE_NAME=$(grep "Phase ${PHASE}:" .planning/ROADMAP.md | sed 's/.*Phase [0-9]*: //' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')
  mkdir -p ".planning/phases/${PADDED_PHASE}-${PHASE_NAME}"
  PHASE_DIR=".planning/phases/${PADDED_PHASE}-${PHASE_NAME}"
fi
```

**File location:** `${PHASE_DIR}/${PADDED_PHASE}-CONTEXT.md`

**Structure the content by what was discussed:**
